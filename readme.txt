Dalvikplugin creates a bridge between the Android browser and the 
Dalvik VM. This makes it possible to deploy and execute hybrid Web 
applications, where DOM extensions are implemented in a VM language 
(such as Java or Scala) and can be consumed by Javascript.

The plugin is currently in alpha state. A description of how to 
build the plugin and how to write Dalvik “Applets” will soon be 
added here.

Some hybrid Webapp sample can be found at:
